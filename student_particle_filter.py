        Adds some random Gaussian noise to the x and y positions of each

        Sets the weight of each particle inversely proportional to the
        particle’s distance from the desired pose. ie, if a particle is close
        to the desired pose, it should have a high weight, and if a particle
        is far from the desired pose, it should have a low weight. Recall that
        X is inversely proportional to Y if X = 1/Y. This weighting scheme will
        ensure that particles closest to the target have higher weights, and
        thus are resampled with a higher probability.

        Uses the particle weights to resample the particles and create a new set.
        The goal is for each particle to be resampled with a probability that
        corresponds to its weight, therefore the particle set converges on the
        desired pose (particles closest to the target pose are more likely to be
        resampled). This method is tricky and has been implemented for you.
